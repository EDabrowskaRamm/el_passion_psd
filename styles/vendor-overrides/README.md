# Vendors-overrides
Put vendor styles overrides here.
This is to avoid editing the vendor files themselves, which is generally not a good idea.

Files named exactly after the vendors they overwrite.

Examples: 

* `vendors-extensions/bootstrap.sass` for bootstrap
* `vendors-extensions/react-select.sass` for react-select
